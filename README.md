# DSA-LinkedList

Mystery program
    - I think its inputing a linked list, searching for a duplicate of the
      first value, then if it finds a duplicate it deletes all other values
      and returns the list with only that value. time complexity is O(1) in 
      best case and O(n) in worst case b/c it iterates through list one by
      one till it finds the value.
